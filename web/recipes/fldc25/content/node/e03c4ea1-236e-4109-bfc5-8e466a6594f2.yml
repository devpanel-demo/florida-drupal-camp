      value: "<p>We have all been there. We submit an article or technical content and the editorial team formats it in a way that changes the content or breaks accessibility.</p><p>Often, writers will submit their content in Google Docs. An editor then has to strip out all of Google's Gremlins to paste into the Drupal editor, so they end up with just a wall of text, left to add headings, links, bullets, and code blocks, and maybe in a way that changes the content.</p><h2>Enter Markdown!&nbsp;</h2><p>Markdown is very popular for authors and developers. It's lightweight and straightforward to learn. Its open format allows it to be used across environments and tools, and you can keep control over your editorial experience. And guess what? It's in CKEditor 5.</p><p>In this talk, we'll learn about the benefits of Markdown and move through some of the basic syntax so you can start using Markdown immediately (live demo). We can also do a quick review of editors that have gentle learning curves.</p><h2>Three takeaways</h2><ul><li>Platforms can easily convert Markdown to HTML</li><li>Markdown has a very gentle learning curve and is human-readable</li><li>Drupal Core and contributed modules support Markdown<br>&nbsp;</li></ul>"
