      value: '<p>I recently found myself returning to traditional Drupal theming after multiple years working primarily in decoupled front ends. While I was admittedly nervous about losing access to some of my go-to tools, I was excited to put Single Directory Components (SDCs) through their paces to understand what impact they would have on my theming workflow.</p><p>Spoiler alert: SDCs are pretty great. In many ways they exceeded my expectations, providing a sturdy bridge to the techniques I learned in my time away from Twig. But at the same time, they still face some of the constraints I bumped up against in past Drupal themes.</p><p>In this session I will walk through the workflow I used to build a custom Drupal theme that relies heavily on Single Directory Components. Together weâ€™ll look at the good and the bad, and also pick up some tips and tricks along the way, including:</p><ul><li>SDC friendly approaches to prototyping outside of Drupal.</li><li>Mapping concepts from JavaScript components to Single Directory Components.</li><li>Leveraging SDCs to simplify your build process.</li><li>Mapping SDCs to Paragraphs and other Drupal entities.</li><li>Indispensable SDC related tools from the contrib ecosystem.</li><li>Where SDCs fall short and my dreams for the future of SDCs and Drupal theming.</li></ul>'
