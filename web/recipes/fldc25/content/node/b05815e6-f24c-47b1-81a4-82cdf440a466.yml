We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help to ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Need Help? Have Questions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our contact details in the emails we've sent and on our <a href=\"/contact\">contact page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need to report a Code of Conduct violation during the event, please find a volunteer and ask to speak with <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/ultimike\">Mike Anello</a> or <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/volkswagenchick\">AmyJune Hineline</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Quick Version</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise, create a sexualized environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll have a volunteer ribbon on their badge. Conference staff can also be found all day at the Florida DrupalCamp&nbsp;registration area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">Original source and credit: <a href=\"http://2012.jsconf.us/#/about\">http://2012.jsconf.us/#/about</a> &amp;&amp; <a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy\">The Ada Initiative</a><br />\r\nPlease help by translating or improving: <a href=\"http://github.com/leftlogic/confcodeofconduct.com\">http://github.com/leftlogic/confcodeofconduct.com</a><br />\r\nThis work is licensed under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US\">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a></div>\r\n"
