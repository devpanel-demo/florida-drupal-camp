      value: '<p><span>Drupal was launched in 2009! The era when Facebook was coming out of the shadows and Web2 was cementing itself in the world while Web1 was fading away.</span><br><br><span>If the folks would remember, those were the days of open protocol, open source advocacy. Microsoft vs Linux and proprietary was looked down upon.</span><br><br><span>Then proprietary won, open internet became a dream and Web2 cemented itself with monopolies. Web2 failed to achieve the vision of the founders of the internet.</span><br><br><span>What was missing was the monetization component of it. Web2 incentivized keeping the gates locked to make money. While projects like Drupal flourished slowly, hundreds of open source developers never saw the same returns as folks working in the proprietary world.</span><br><br><span>Web3 is changing that. With crypto at its core, Web3 is structured to incentivize the community, encourage contribution and ensure that the money &amp; power is not within only a few people. Web3 would achieve what Web2 didn’t.</span><br><br><span>We would walk into a make believe world which would focus on:</span><br><br><span>--&gt; What if Drupal was launched in Web3 world</span><br><span>How would the core contributors, module developers and agencies would make money</span><br><span>--&gt; How Dries would’ve never needed to start Acquia :)</span><br><span>--&gt; How the ecosystem would’ve taken platforms like SiteCore and Adobe.</span><br><span>--&gt; And can we do this now! $DRUPAL coins! How would it work?</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is a fun thought experiment talk! No takeaways, but we can definitely explore the world of open source technology where the contribution motivation is driven by made up coins.</span><br><br><span>With what is happening in Wordpress world! This is great fun/thought experiment.</span></p>'
