In this case, we’re working on various Drupal issues.</p><h2>What will we be working on?</h2><p>Check back soon for more info about the plan for Florida DrupalCamp 2025</p><h2>First-time contributor?</h2><p>Is this your first time contributing? Not a coder? That’s perfectly fine! There will be mentors available for those who need a little help to get started.&nbsp;</p><p>We will have a few tables dedicated to mentoring not only novices but novices to the issue queue. There will be help&nbsp;setting up the necessary tools, understanding which types of issues to work on, and even some live demos of the complete contribution&nbsp;process.</p><p>Not everyone who works on open source projects is a developer. Smaller tasks help the less experienced gain confidence and experience, which, in turn, leads to more contributions. Code is very important, but so are all the other parts.</p><h2>Be prepared to have a good time…</h2><p>Trust us, it’s a lot of fun when you get into it. It’s an excellent opportunity to meet other contributors, help collaborate and brainstorm, and move the Drupal project forward.</p><p>Honestly, it''s a pretty good time.</p><h2>Do you have more questions?</h2><p><a class="button button--primary" href="https://www.fldrupal.camp/contact">Email us!</a></p>'
