      value: '<p dir="ltr"><span>This session invites you to explore the power of headless Drupal using JSON:API and GraphQL backends. It will help you to unlock a more flexible and dynamic content delivery for decoupled front-ends especially evaluating when to use JSON:API versus GraphQL. You will gain insight into how these APIs provide powerful options for managing and delivering content to a variety of front-end applications. You will dive into the architecture, understand the strengths and trade-offs of each API, and discover how they can complement your modern front-end development efforts.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We will also discuss the differences between a monolithic Drupal setup—where built-in features like menus, user authentication, and form handling come out of the box—and a decoupled architecture where such functionalities require custom front-end development.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Attendees will gain strategic insights into setting up and optimizing JSON:API and GraphQL for a truly decoupled Drupal experience. While we won’t engage in hands-on coding, we will share code samples to illustrate implementation strategies, best practices, and potential real-world use cases.</span><br><br><span>Join us to explore how JSON:API and GraphQL empower headless Drupal architectures to deliver content seamlessly across digital channels. This session will cover architectural considerations, API setup, and front-end integration while comparing the built-in advantages of monolithic Drupal to the flexibility of a decoupled approach.</span></p>'
