To run the recipe run.

Notes: Some changes were made to accommodate for said commands.

1. Such as --existing config requires a change from standard to minimal profile on the coreâ€”extensions file.
2. One of the views had its config altered since there are no taxonomies when it loads they get added after and hence it does not save that preference.
3. Emails were modified to @demo address.
